# ImageGallery
This is my reworked project from previous one in Projects repository - gallery-mvc. 
My previous project was written with maven, java 8, junit 4 and spring 3.
This one I wanted to modernise a bit so I have rewritten my project with Java 8, Junit 5, Spring 5 and gradle as a small challenge.
Did a lot of refactoring and implemented Rest controllers.

# How to build it
On source directory run command: gradle build

# To Do List
1. Fix tests and add new ones - reach 100 coverage
2. Build with docker - add gradle task for docker + Dockerfile
3. Build front-end
4. After front-end is done add seleniums + cucumber scripts
