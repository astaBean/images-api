This is a project I do from time to time to experiment with newer versions with java, build tools, etc.

# How to build it
On source directory run command: gradle build

# Running tests from IntelliJ
Go to File -> Settings -> Buid, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle
Set setting `Run tests using` to IntelliJ IDEA instead of gradle

**Note:** Make sure your system is on default **Java 8** version if not then the tests won't run from IntelliJ.

# To Do List
1. Fix integration tests
2. Add new controller to get notification messages
4. Build small consumer of the api
5. Maybe add some seleniums + cucumber scripts
